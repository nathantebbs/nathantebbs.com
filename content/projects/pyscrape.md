## About PyScrape

As a Computer Science student at the University of Arizona, I often found myself navigating course websites and manually downloading contentâ€”an inconvenient process that took me out of the terminal environment I preferred working in.

To streamline this task, I began developing **PyScrape**, a command-line tool for downloading static content from static websites.

## Usage

PyScrape is currently a work in progress. At this stage, it supports downloading PDFs from a given webpage. Support for additional file types such as DOCX documents, images, and presentations is planned for future releases, as the project continues to evolve.
