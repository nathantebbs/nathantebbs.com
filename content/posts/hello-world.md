# How to use this website

Hello, this website is the hub for all information that you would like to know about me. To know more about my journey so far checkout the `About` page. The `Projects` page is a showcase for all my completed projects so far. To see my works in progress, checkout my [GitHub](https://github.com/nathantebbs).

# Plans going forward

Over the next few months expect a lot of changes to occur here! I am still working out the specifics of the look, feeling, and functionality of this website. Luckily, my courseload has lightened up over the summer so I am going to be putting most of my time and energy into my personal projects, including nathantebbs.com. So check back periodically to see what I've been getting up to.
