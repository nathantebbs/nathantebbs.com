# Hi!

Welcome to nathantebbs.com. I'm a systems-focused CS student at the University of Arizona, and this site is where I collect notes on things I'm building and learning.

## What I Work On

Most of my time goes into writing production-style Linux services in C, Go, and Rust. I'm drawn to the problems that show up when you need software to run reliably on real networks—service hardening, failure-aware design, and the operational details that don't fit neatly into a textbook.

Some recent projects:

- **gaterelay** – A secure TCP relay service for Linux
- **c2** – A command-and-control simulator for controlled lab environments
- **tucson-crime-analysis** – Multivariate analysis of Tucson crime data against socioeconomic factors

## Why This Site

I wanted a place to document the problems I run into and how I solve them. Writing things down forces me to understand them properly, and maybe someone else will find the notes useful.

The site itself is intentionally minimal.
