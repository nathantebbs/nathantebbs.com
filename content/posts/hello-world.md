## How to Use This Website

Welcome! This site serves as the central hub for everything you'd like to know about me. To learn more about my journey so far, check out the `About` page. The `Projects` page highlights the work I've completed, and for ongoing projects and experiments, you can follow along on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nathantebbs).

The home page features my blog posts—less formal entries where I dive into projects, topics that interest me, and occasional announcements.

## Plans Going Forward

Expect to see lots of changes over the next few months! I'm still refining the look, feel, and functionality of this site. With a lighter course load over the summer, I’m focusing more on personal projects—especially `nathantebbs.com`. Be sure to check back periodically to see what's new!
