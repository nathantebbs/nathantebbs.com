# Hi, I'm Nathan

I am currently attending the University of Arizona in pursuit of a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am passionate about web development, low-level programming, theoretical computer science, and data science.

In the Spring 2025 semester, I served as a TA for CSc 346 (Cloud Computing). This experience strengthened my background in web development and gave me valuable insight into teaching. I also co-authored a group data analysis [report](/tucson-crime-analysis.pdf) on Tucson crime statistics. For a more casual overview, you can check out my blog post about the report [here](/posts/crime-data-analysis.md).

# Academics

I am expected to graduate from the University of Arizona with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in Spring 2026. Below are some notable courses I have completed:

- CSc 144: Discrete Mathematics I  
- CSc 244: Discrete Mathematics II  
- CSc 210: Software Development  
- CSc 335: Object-Oriented Programming and Design  
- CSc 352: Systems Programming and UNIX  
- CSc 345: Analysis of Discrete Structures  
- CSc 346: Cloud Computing  
- CSc 380: Data Analysis  
- CSc 391: Preceptorship (TA for CSc 346)

Before attending the University of Arizona, I earned my Associate in Arts degree through the [Running Start program](https://www.sbctc.edu/colleges-staff/programs-services/running-start/) while in high school. During this time, I also attended Olympia High School in Olympia, Washington.
