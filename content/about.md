        <p>I attended High School and earned my Associate's degree in Olympia, Washington. After earning my diplomas
        I moved to Tucson, Arizona to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, where I am now expected to graduate
        in Spring of next year.</p>
        <p>During High School, I joined an after school <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/frc/" target="_blank">FRC</a> program,
        and found team <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/frc/" target="_blank">4450</a>. During my two years as Safety Captain
        I was exposed to the engineering process in a competative environment, while also leading a capstone expidition to a
        partner junior robotics team to bring metal based robotics to Cairo, Egypt.</p>
