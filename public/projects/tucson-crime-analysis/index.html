Datasets Tucson Police Reported Crimes Tucson Police Arrests City of Tucson Streetlight Locations Tucson Neighborhood Income Findings We found that lower-income neighborhoods—particularly in Wards 3 and 5—experience higher rates of theft and violent crime, supporting the link between income inequality and crime. However, the presence of streetlights did not correspond with reduced crime rates. In fact, streetlights were more common in high-crime areas, suggesting they are likely installed in response to crime rather than as a deterrent. Machine learning models, especially Random Forest, were effective in predicting high-crime areas, but the findings also raise ethical concerns about over-policing and data bias. These concerns underscore the importance of thoughtful, equitable policy interventions.
