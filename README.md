Go to my website [here](https://nathantebbs.com). The site is build using hugo,
however, on the development side I have also integrated [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/) to allow for the usage
of org files.

## Usage

### Development
```bash
hugo server -D --disableFastRender
```

### Publishing
```bash
hugo build
```
